This notebook conducts the following tasks to assist a potential buyer in finding a home that will meet a set of prescribed preferences:

1. loads a real estate listing from a CSV file, 
2. creates embeddings for the property description of each listing and stores them in the Chroma vectorstore for query,
3. collects home and neighborhood preferences from a potential buyer,
4. uses the retriever utility function in LangChain to locate a set of listings that best match the user-provided preferences in home size and budget,
5. uses GPT-3-turbo-0125 language model to provide a summary description for each home that resonates with the potential buyer.
